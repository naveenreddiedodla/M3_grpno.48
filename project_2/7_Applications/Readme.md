## Applications:

When the door handle is pulled (or some similar trigger is activated) the base unit located within the vehicle emits a short range, low frequency signal – polling for a nearby key fob transponder. If present, the key fob recognizes the signal and responds with a UHF (ultra-high frequency) signal, transmitting a code to be authenticated by the base unit encryption firmware
