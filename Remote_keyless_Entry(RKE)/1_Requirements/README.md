# Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock
## 1.1 Description
### A remote keyless entry system simply refers to any electronic lock that functions without the use of a mechanical key. Commonly, this comes in the form of a key fob, with buttons that communicate using radio frequency (RF) signals with a receiver to perform a certain action, such as locking or unlocking a vehicle.
## 1.2 components Required:
### A transmitter and a receiver.
Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated Receiver-Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE
#### 2.RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency

## 1.3 Features
### It shall activation/deactivation alarm for Three User Button Clicks.
### It shall Lock the car for one User Button Click.
### It shall activate approach light for Four User Button Clicks.
### It shall Unlock the car Two User Button Clicks.

## 1.4 State of art
### Alarm system and Approach light are also available with a button press.
### Buttons shall be provided to ease the access of available features.
### Lock and Unlock the car with a button press.
### Hack proof security is provided with encription.

### WHY
This project will help us to lock the vehicle and unlock the vehicle remotly when needed .
 we can control the car from a distance. More security and easy to use. 


### WHAT
 RKE systems for cars can be used to control the vehicle's ignition system, security alarm, horn, lights and trunk.


### WHERE
It is used to control entry to premises and specific areas of buildings, such as garages parking lots etc
 
### WHEN

To secure you vehicle on parking .    

### HOW
By using a small Radio Transmitter and reciver we will make our project work.

# 1.6 Swot Analysis:
## Strengths:
### No need of human interaction with car. Excellent Safety protocol is used(Encryption). Easy usage of features with a user press button
## Weaknesses:
### Limited Usage Range *Not able to see the status of the car "Interrupts or Timers would be good instead of delay.
## Opportunities:
### Wide scope in field of automobiles. *Cost Efficient. *Car Safety is assured helps in increase in demand.
## Threats:
### Less accurate timing We should wait until completion of a task to run an other task.

# 2 Requirements:
## 2.1 High Level Requirements:
1.System shall be provided with Approach Light
2.System shall be provided with wireless Alarm activation and Deactivation
3.System shall be made as Hack proof
4.System shall be provided with wireless Lock and Unlock system

## 2.2 Low Level Requirement :
1. In case of mistouch the doors will be opened .

## APPLICATIONS:

Remote keyless entry systems, now fairly commonplace devices, provide car owners with a degree of convenience, making the task of physically inserting a key unnecessary. A passive keyless entry (PKE) system uses advanced technology to take vehicle accessibility to a higher level.
