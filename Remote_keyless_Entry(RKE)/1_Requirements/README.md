# Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock
## 1.1 Description
### A remote keyless entry system simply refers to any electronic lock that functions without the use of a mechanical key. Commonly, this comes in the form of a key fob, with buttons that communicate using radio frequency (RF) signals with a receiver to perform a certain action, such as locking or unlocking a vehicle.
## 1.2 components Required:
### A transmitter and a receiver.
Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated Receiver-Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE
#### 2.RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency

## 1.3 Features
### LCD display should be provided on the keyfob to display the car's status.
### High security is provided to unlock the system.
### It shall print the car's window status on LCD (Blue switch on - All led on at the same time)
### It shall print the car's alarm status on LCD (Blue switch press two times - All led off at the same time)
### It shall print the car's battery information on LCD (Blue switch press three times - All led on in clockwise manner)
### It shall print the car's door status on LCD (Blue switch press four times - All led on in clockwise manner)

## 1.4 State of art
### The main focus of this project is to operate the car's window , alarm , battery and door. The frequency set in the RKE will be matched with the car as per requirements set in the code. A security code shall be fixed which ensures security to the car. A LCD screen can be seen which displays all the current status of the car. We can further operate the car using this information.By combining all these features a final product is made known as BiCom. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of automations are very useful in our daily lives.

### WHY
This project will help us to lock the vehicle and unlock the vehicle remotly when needed .
 we can control the car from a distance. More security and easy to use. 


### WHAT
 RKE systems for cars can be used to control the vehicle's ignition system, security alarm, horn, lights and trunk.


### WHERE
It is used to control entry to premises and specific areas of buildings, such as garages parking lots etc
 
### WHEN

To secure you vehicle on parking .    

### HOW
By using a small Radio Transmitter and reciver we will make our project work.

# 1.5 Swot Analysis:
## Strengths:
### No need of human interaction with car. Excellent Safety protocol is used(Encryption). Easy usage of features with a user press button
