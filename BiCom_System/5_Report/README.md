# About the BiCom System
## 1.1 Description:
### This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directionaL. Information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.
## 1.2 Features:
### High security is provided to unlock the system.
### It shall print the car's window status on LCD (Blue switch on - All led on at the same time)
### It shall print the car's alarm status on LCD (Blue switch press two times - All led off at the same time)
### LCD display should be provided on the keyfob to display the car's status.
### It shall print the car's battery information on LCD (Blue switch press three times - All led on in clockwise manner)
### It shall print the car's door status on LCD (Blue switch press four times - All led on in clockwise manner)

## 1.3 State of art
### The main focus of this project is to operate the car's window , alarm , battery and door. The frequency set in the RKE will be matched with the car as per requirements set in the code. A security code shall be fixed which ensures security to the car. A LCD screen can be seen which displays all the current status of the car. We can further operate the car using this information.By combining all these features a final product is made known as BiCom. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of automations are very useful in our daily lives.

# 1.4 5 W's 1 H
## Who :
### Driver - The one who drives the car.
## What : 
### Thing - We are operating everything through BiCom.
## When :
### Time - Whenever people are travelling.
## Where :
### place - Anywhere in the locality up to a certain distance.
## Why : 
### Reason - To control their car easily and safely.
## How :
### Steps - Just using RKE.

# 1.5 SWOT ANALYSIS:

## Strengths:

### No need of human interaction with car Status with different features is provided. "Easy usage of features with a user press button.

## Weaknesses:

### Limited Usage Range Less security to our system Interrupts or Timers would be good instead of delay so system works faster.

## Opportunities:

### Wide scope in field of automobiles Cost Efficient Car features are tremendous which increases car value.

## Threats:

### Less accurate timing We should wait until completion of a task to run an other task.

# 2 Requirements:
## 2.1 High Level Requirements:

| ID |High Level Requirements|
|----|--------------------|
|HLR1|System shall display Alarm status of the car|  
|HLR2|system shall display Display status of the car|  
|HLR3|System shall display Battery status of the car|
