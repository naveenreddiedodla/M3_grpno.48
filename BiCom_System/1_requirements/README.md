### This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directional i.e.., information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.

#   SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths

### No need of human interaction with car *Car Status with different features is provided. "Easy usage of features with a user press button.

## Weaknesses

### Limited Usage Range "Less security to our system "Interrupts or Timers would be good instead of delay so system works faster.

## Opportunities

### Wide scope in field of automobiles "Cost Efficient *Car features are tremendous which increases car value.

## Threats

### Less accurate timing We should wait until completion of a task to run an other task.
