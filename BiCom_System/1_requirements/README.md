# About the BiCom System
## 1.1 Description
### This BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. Here the bi-directional communication takes place in between the keyfob and the car. As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directional i.e.., information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display.

## 1.3 State of art
### The main focus of this project is to operate the car's window , alarm , battery and door. The frequency set in the RKE will be matched with the car as per requirements set in the code. A security code shall be fixed which ensures security to the car. A LCD screen can be seen which displays all the current status of the car. We can further operate the car using this information.By combining all these features a final product is made known as BiCom. As the technology is increasing rapidly these kind of automations are very useful in our daily lives.
